# Faction Tokens

This module will allow you to assign tokens to factions by leveraging the built-in token disposition colors, leveraging an actor's folder color, or defining your own custom replacement colors for token dispositions.

## Configuration

* Install the Faction Tokens module
* Enable the Faction Tokens module in System Settings -> Manage Modules
* Configure which colors are used in System Settings -> Module Settings under Faction Tokens

## Round Tokens

Round tokens require an additional frame to be generated to cover the built-in frames. You can do this on a per-token basis or configure it once in the actor's token prototype

* Open the actor and click prototype token in the upper right, or double-right-click a tokens
* open the Image tab and check the Overlay A Faction-Based Frame option
